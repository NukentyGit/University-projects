# Project 1 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

A simple workflow demonstrates essential skills in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using Python. It covers the full process, including **data loading, preprocessing, visualization and analysis**, providing a hands-on example of how to explore and understand a dataset efficiently.

## 📝 Description

This project analyzes a dataset of **Italian extra virgin olive oils** from different regions.
The data is stored in the file `olive_oil.xlsx` and includes:

- **Category index** (first column) indicating the region of origin:  
  - SA → Southern Apulia  
  - NA → Northern Apulia  
  - WL → West Liguria  
  - EL → East Liguria 
  - U  → Umbria

- **Concentrations of 7 fatty acids** determined via chromatography (column names in the first row).

## 🎯 Objectives

- Load and manage datasets
- Clean and preprocess data for analysis (formatting, transformations)
- Perform a complete Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Generate clear and meaningful visualizations
- Derive useful insights from data, identifying patterns, trends and anomalies

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python 3.13.0
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

---

## ⏱️ Execution Time

- Full notebook execution: ~30 seconds on an average-performing laptop

---

## 🚀 Result  

- The EDA highlighted differences in fatty acid concentrations among the Italian regions, showing clear regional patterns.
- Visualizations (boxplots, histograms, pairplots) revealed outliers and anomalies in some samples, helping identify potential errors or unusual values.
- Correlation analysis suggested relationships between certain fatty acids, which could be useful for classification or clustering.

Overall, this workflow demonstrates how systematic exploration of a dataset provides insights into trends, variability, and potential predictive features.
